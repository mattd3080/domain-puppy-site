  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 23, 2026</p>

  <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and Retrogram Music LLC ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") governing your use of the Domain Puppy skill, website, and related services (collectively, the "Service").</p>

  <p><strong>By installing, copying, running, or otherwise using the Domain Puppy skill (including by running the command <code>bunx skills add mattd3080/domain-puppy</code>), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</strong></p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>Your use of the Service constitutes acceptance of these Terms. This includes, without limitation, installing the skill, executing the skill command, or accessing any output or functionality provided by the Service. No separate signature or click-through is required; use of the Service is sufficient to establish your agreement.</p>

  <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>Domain Puppy is a domain name lookup and availability tool. The Service queries third-party domain registrars and data sources to provide domain availability information. We do not register, sell, broker, or transfer domain names.</p>

  <h2>3. No Warranty</h2>
  <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement;</li>
    <li>Any warranty that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free;</li>
    <li>Any warranty regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of domain availability data or any other information provided through the Service;</li>
    <li>Any warranty that results obtained from the use of the Service will be accurate or reliable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL RETROGRAM MUSIC LLC, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS, OR ASSIGNS BE LIABLE FOR ANY:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages;</li>
    <li>Loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or business opportunity;</li>
    <li>Damages arising from your use of or inability to use the Service;</li>
    <li>Damages arising from any inaccuracy in domain availability information;</li>
    <li>Damages arising from unauthorized access to or alteration of your data or transmissions;</li>
    <li>Any other damages arising out of or in connection with the Service;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY CASE, OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE DOLLAR ($1.00 USD).</p>

  <h2>5. Assumption of Risk</h2>
  <p>You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Service is entirely at your own risk. You assume full responsibility for any decisions made based on information provided by the Service, including but not limited to domain name registration decisions, purchasing decisions, or business decisions.</p>

  <h2>6. Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Retrogram Music LLC and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and assigns from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your use or misuse of the Service;</li>
    <li>Your violation of these Terms;</li>
    <li>Your violation of any applicable law or regulation;</li>
    <li>Any claim by a third party related to your use of the Service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The Service may rely on or interact with third-party APIs, registrars, and data providers. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or performance of any third-party service. Your use of third-party services is subject to their respective terms and policies.</p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Website Access</h2>
  <p>Domain Puppy provides domain availability information using public protocols (RDAP, WHOIS) and authorized third-party APIs. Some users may choose to use their own browser automation tools (such as Playwright) to visit registrar websites independently. Any such automated browsing is initiated and controlled entirely by the user on their own machine. Domain Puppy does not operate, host, or control any browser-based scraping service. Users are solely responsible for their compliance with any third-party website's terms of service when using their own tools.</p>

  <h2>9. Data Accuracy</h2>
  <p>Domain availability and pricing information is provided for informational purposes only. Results may be incomplete, delayed, or inaccurate. You should confirm all availability and pricing directly with the registrar before making a purchase. Domain Puppy makes no guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of any domain data presented.</p>

  <h2>10. Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
  <p>Domain Puppy may earn commissions when you purchase domains through links to partner registrars and marketplaces. This commercial relationship does not influence which domains are displayed or the order in which they appear.</p>

  <h2>11. No Liability for Domain Purchases</h2>
  <p>Domain Puppy facilitates domain discovery only. All purchases occur through third-party registrars and marketplaces. Domain Puppy is not a party to any domain transaction and assumes no liability for disputes, pricing errors, failed transactions, or domain ownership issues arising from purchases made through linked third-party services.</p>

  <h2>12. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>All content, trademarks, and intellectual property associated with the Service are owned by Retrogram Music LLC or its licensors. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Service without prior written consent.</p>

  <h2>13. Termination</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, for any reason, without notice or liability. Upon termination, all provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive will survive, including warranty disclaimers, limitations of liability, and indemnification obligations.</p>

  <h2>14. Modifications</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes are effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the Service after any modification constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Idaho, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Idaho. You irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts.</p>

  <h2>16. Severability</h2>
  <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect.</p>

  <h2>17. Entire Agreement</h2>
  <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Retrogram Music LLC regarding the Service and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral.</p>

  <h2>18. Contact</h2>
